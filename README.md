# H3LIS331D
ST Microelectronics' Hi-g accelerometer

 Demonstrate basic H3LIS331 functionality including parameterizing the register addresses, initializing the sensor, 
 getting properly scaled accelerometer data out. Sketch runs on the 3.3 V 8 MHz Pro Mini and the Teensy 3.1.
 
 The H3LIS331DL is a low-power high-performance 3-axis linear accelerometer 
 belonging to the “nano” family, with digital I2C/SPI serial interface standard output. 
 The device features ultra-low power operational modes that allow advanced power saving and 
 smart sleep-to-wakeup functions.The H3LIS331DL has dynamically user-selectable full scales of ±100 g/±200g/±400g
 and it is capable of measuring accelerations with output data rates from 0.5 Hz to 1 kHz.
 The H3LIS331DL is available in a small thin plastic land grid array package (LGA) and it is 
 guaranteed to operate over an extended temperature range from -40 °C to +85 °C
